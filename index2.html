                    <p id="p">Lionel Messi gave Argentina, one of the favourites to win the tournament, a 10th-minute lead from the penalty spot with a coolly taken spot kick.
                        But two goals early in the second half, including an outstanding strike from Salem Al-Dawsari, turned the game on its head and left the Albiceleste with little margin for error against Mexico and Poland in their other Group C fixtures.
                        Argentina came into the game the overwhelmingly favorite. They were on course to match Italy's record 37-match unbeaten run when they went ahead early on thanks to Messi's penalty, which came about after a VAR check for pushing and shoving in the box.
                        Messi, playing in his fifth World Cup, beat Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Owais on a breakaway, but that goal and two others by Lautaro Martinez were ruled offside as Saudi Arabia's high defensive line held firm.
                        Saleh Al-Shehri squeezed in a low shot in the 48th minute, and Al-Dawsari curled in a scorching strike from the edge of the penalty area in the 53rd minute to leave Argentina looking on in disbelief.

                        - World Cup's biggest upsets: Argentina's loss joins hall of shame                       
                        Despite plenty of possession after that, Argentina were unable to break down Saudi Arabia, who were competing in their sixth World Cup but had never previously won an opening game.                        
                        Al-Owais saved well at point-blank range to deny Argentina when Lisandro Martinez's shot deflected off Nicolas Tagliafico, but Lionel Scaloni's side, who have four players older than 34 in their starting XI, looked tired in the final 30 minutes.                        
                        Saudi Arabia fans, meanwhile, chanted "Where is Messi? We beat him!" as they celebrated their shock lead.
                        As Saudi Arabia, who at 51st are the second-lowest-ranked team in the tournament, closed in on a famous victory, the game was delayed after a nasty collision between Al-Owais and defender Yasser Al-Shahrani that resulted in Al-Shahrani leaving the pitch on a stretcher.</p>

                    <p id="p1">Lionel Messi rescued Argentina from the brink of World Cup elimination, scoring the crucial opening goal in a 2-0 win over Mexico at Lusail Iconic Stadium in Qatar to put the South American champions back on track to reach the last 16.

                        Argentina were being frustrated Saturday by a stubborn, physical Mexico side until Messi produced a moment of magic, firing the ball low into the corner of the net from 20 yards in the 64th minute.
                        
                        With the deadlock broken and space finally starting to open up, Enzo Fernandez curled in a brilliant first goal for his country in the 87th minute to ensure the vital three points.
                        After a stunning 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in their opener Tuesday, Argentina knew that a defeat against Mexico would see them eliminated from the competition while a draw would leave their hopes hanging by a thread.
                        
                        But thanks to the two moments of magic from Messi and Fernandez, one of the pre-tournament favorites will go into their final Group C match in second place, one point behind their next opponent, Poland.
                        
                        A win would be enough to guarantee their progress to the knockout stage, while a draw could be sufficient depending on the result of the other remaining game.
                        
                        Mexico, who again offered precious little going forward, have just a single point from their first two games following an opening goalless draw with Poland. El Tri will need to beat Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to stand a chance of finishing in the top two.</p>

                        Second-half goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez were plenty for Argentina, who were shocked by Saudi Arabia in their group opener, to keep their quest for a first World Cup title since 1986 alive.
                        It's so emotional for me, for the whole squad. It's a dream come true," Mac Allister told reporters. "I debuted with this team, I'm so proud of that. And now managing to score in a World Cup. I'm so happy.
                        
                        "[After Messi's penalty miss] we tried to stay positive, to stay calm. We did not feel down. We tried to be optimistic. Fortunately we managed to win and go through."
                        
                        Despite being thoroughly outplayed through the 90 minutes, Poland also snuck into the knockout round in second place thanks to a superior goal difference over Mexico and will face Group D winners France on Sunday. Argentina is set to face Australia on Saturday with a spot in the quarterfinals on the line.
                        
                        Messi was playing in his 22nd game at the World Cup -- and 999th of his career for club and country -- breaking a tie with Diego Maradona for the most by an Argentine in the world's biggest tournament
                        Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny saved a Messi penalty that was awarded by VAR as Argentina dominated the first 45 minutes but had nothing to show for it with the halftime score 0-0.
                        
                        Szczesny had been kept busy the entire half with the Poland defence breached time and again, but the Juventus keeper stood firm to deny the Argentines who grew more confident with every attack.
                        
                        He first denied Alvarez, who broke through the offside trap before he tipped Angel Di Maria's cross over the bar when his Juve teammate attempted to score directly from a corner kick.
                        
                        The opener for Argentina came right after the restart when Brighton striker Mac Allister redirected a Nahuel Molina cross with a first-time shot that trickled past Szczesny and off the far post.
                        
                        Manchester City teenager Alvarez announced himself on the world stage and doubled Argentina's lead midway through the second half, picking up a pass from Enzo Fernandez in the penalty area and lashing a shot past Szczesny to all but secure the three points.
                        
                        With Poland's spot in the round of 16 looking like it could come down to a fair play (yellow and red card accumulation) tiebreaker with Mexico, Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz had instructed his players to avoid unnecessary bookings as the match wore on.
                        
                        "I didn't tell players to take their foot off the ball, but I did tell them to avoid silly bookings," Michniewicz told a news conference. "We even talked about the yellow cards for those on the bench, because it was only before the match, after the meeting with the delegate, when we learned that cards awarded to players on the bench do not count for the fair play classification.
                        
             "We were afraid that one of the players would jump out, or the coach, and would get booked and therefore we might not advance further. But I also asked that we do not provoke, not pull their shirts, not argue with the referee.</p>

                    <p id="p4">Lionel Messi spearheaded Argentina's charge to the World Cup quarterfinals by helping to secure a 2-1 victory against Australia on Saturday.

                        In his 1,000th career match, Messi scored the opening goal with a sublime effort before Julian Alvarez scored in the second half to set up a quarterfinal tie against the Netherlands and knock Australia out of the tournament, as the Socceroos were unable to build upon their fortuitous late goal.
                        I am very happy for taking another step forward, achieving another objective," Messi said. "It was a very strong and difficult match -- we knew it was going to be this way.
                        
                        "We didn't have much time to rest up and we were concerned as we knew it was going to be a physical match and they were very strong. Luckily we found the goal and we were one goal ahead, and then two goals ahead.
                        
                        "And then we had a setback with the goal -- but that's the World Cup for you, the matches are difficult and we got the win."
                        
                        Despite Argentina's firepower, Australia managed to limit the early proceedings, keeping them uneventful with neither side exerting any dominance.
                        
                        But the Socceroos' defence was breached on 35 minutes as Messi showed his undeniable quality to score his first-ever goal in the World Cup knockout stage.
                        
                        The Paris Saint-Germain forward started the move with a darting run inside from the right wing -- a quick exchange of passes landed him inside the box before he unleashed a left-footed curling shot past Mat Ryan.
                        
                        "He [Messi] is incredible. One of the greatest ever," Australia boss Graham Arnold said. "We really worked hard not to be in awe of him, because of the great player he is.
                        
                        "But wow, he's remarkable. I had the privilege of playing against Diego Maradona, and now coaching against Messi -- they're both wonderful players and Argentina should be so proud and happy to have players of that calibre."
                        
                        Buoyed by rapturous support, Argentina tightened their grip on a quarterfinal spot 12 minutes after half-time as Rodrigo De Paul pounced on a slack touch by Australia goalkeeper Ryan, allowing Alvarez to slot into a vacated net, doubling his side's lead.</p>

                    <p id="p5">Argentina claimed a dramatic 4-3 penalty shootout victory over Netherlands on Friday to claim a spot in the World Cup semifinals after initially throwing away a two-goal lead in a late collapse in regulation time.

                        Lionel Messi converted his penalty in the shootout and Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez saved two attempts. Lautaro Martinez scored the clinching penalty.
                        
                        The match finished 2-2 after extra time, with Messi scoring one goal and setting up another. The Netherlands equalized in the 11th minute of second-half stoppage time.
                        
                        Messi provided a superb assist with a delicately threaded pass to defender Nahuel Molina who slotted past goalkeeper Andries Noppert to hand Argentina a first-half lead. The Paris Saint-Germain forward added Argentina's second on 73 minutes with a well-taken penalty.
                        Messi scored from the penalty spot in the 73rd to make it 2-0 with his fourth goal of this year's World Cup.
                        
                        It took him to 10 goals in the World Cup, tied with Gabriel Batistuta for the most for Argentina, and 94 goals in total in his 169 international games.
                        
                        "Argentina are among the four best in the world because we showed we know how to play every game with the same desire and the same intensity," Messi said after advancing to the World Cup semifinal for the second time in his career.
                        
                        "A lot of joy, a lot of happiness. We didn't have to suffer and playing extra time or going to penalties. But we got through and it's impressive."
                        
                        Wout Weghorst scored a header on 82 to claw one back for Netherlands to set up a tense end that repeatedly boiled over. Netherlands were handed a final lifeline with what looked to be the last kick of the match when midfielder Teun Koopmeiners stepped up to take a free-kick on the edge of the box before sliding a pass under the wall and slotted home by Weghorst.</p>

                    <p id="p6">Lionel Messi put on a sensational display as he helped Argentina secure a spot in the World Cup final with a comfortable 3-0 victory over Croatia on Tuesday.

                        Messi opened the scoring with a powerfully hit penalty on 34 minutes -- becoming Argentina's all-time leading goal scorer at World Cup finals -- and shortly after Alvarez completed a direct solo run through the heart of the Croatia defence before tapping home to double Argentina's lead before half-time.
                        Alvarez added the side's third, thanks in part to a signature run from Messi who used his change of speed to guide past Josko Gvardiol before sliding the ball back to Alvarez for an easy finish.
                        
                        Argentina, who have twice won the World Cup in 1978 and 1986, advance to Sunday's final where they will face either France or Morocco, who play on Wednesday.
                        
                        Croatia, who finished runners up in Russia four years ago, exit the competition after putting together another shock run to the semifinals.
                        
                        "Throughout the World Cup it has been incredible what we have experienced. We are going to play the final which is what we wanted," Messi said.
                        
                        "I don't know if it's my best World Cup, it's been a long time I've been enjoying. This team is crazy. We are going to play one more final, we are going to enjoy all of this."
                        
                        Messi's inclusion in the starting lineup meant he drew level with Germany's Lothar Matthaeus as joint record holder for most World Cup appearances with his 25th game.
                        
                        Croatia wanted possession at the start, as they had done against Brazil in their quarterfinal, and circulated the ball well but struggled to find a way into the Argentina box</p>

                    <p id="p7" style="color: #cfb53b; font-weight: bold;">Argentina beat France 4-2 on penalties to win the 2022 World Cup after a 3-3 draw in a thrilling final at the Lusail Stadium in Doha, Qatar, on Sunday.

                        Argentina raced into a two-goal lead through Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria before two Kylian Mbappe goals saw holders France pull level in spectacular fashion. Messi put Argentina ahead in extra-time before Mbappe completed his hat trick from the penalty spot to send the game to a penalty shootout.
                        The result means Messi, playing in his record 26th and final World Cup match, achieves a fairy-tale ending as he lifts the trophy for the first time -- the only major honour to have eluded him in his career.
                        
                        It is Argentina's third World Cup title after previous victories in 1978 and 1986.
                        
                        "I cannot believe that we have suffered so much in a perfect game. Unbelievable, but this team responds to everything," Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni said.
                        
                        "I am proud of the work they did. It is an exciting group. With the blows we received today, with the draws, this makes you emotional. I want to tell people to enjoy, it's a historic moment for our country."
                        
                        Meanwhile, France, who won the tournament's previous edition in 2018, were denied in their bid to become the first team to win back-to-back World Cups since Brazil in 1962.
                        
                        Di Maria's inclusion over Leandro Paredes was the only change for Argentina from the semifinal victory over Croatia. France made two changes, as Dayot Upamecano and Adrien Rabiot started after missing their semifinal win against Morocco with a virus that impacted the squad this week.
                        
                        France were initially sluggish, as Mbappe barely had a touch on the left wing in the opening stages. Meanwhile, his Argentine counterpart Di Maria looked dangerous and earned a penalty on 21 minutes when he went down under a clumsy challenge from France's Ousmane Dembele. Messi stepped up to convert and calmly rolled the ball into the bottom-left corner.
                        
                        Di Maria starred once again shortly after when Messi set midfielder Alexis Mac Allister free down the right wing before he slotted across to an eagerly arriving Di Maria, who struck past France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. It was Di Maria's third straight final with a goal for Argentina, his previous coming in the 2021 Copa America final victory over Brazil.
                        France were uncharacteristically weak going forward, and by 41 minutes, Deschamps made his first substitutions, bringing on Randal Kolo Muani and Marcus Thuram for Olivier Giroud and Dembele.
                        
                        Argentina continued to dominate for much of the second half, but France, who took until 71 minutes to register a shot, burst into life late in the game and were rewarded when substitute Kolo Muani won a penalty with little more than 10 minutes remaining, which Mbappe scored.
                        
                        Mbappe scored again just 97 seconds later as France won the ball back at the halfway-line before eventually feeding the PSG man with a floated pass on the edge of the box that he volleyed into the bottom right corner.
                        
                        Argentina's once vibrant attack was then deflated as they desperately held on before Messi, with almost the last kick of regulation time, struck a shot from 25 yards that forced Lloris into a spectacular save, sending the game to extra-time.
                        
                        The drama did not end there. Argentina thought they had won it when Messi pounced to slot home a parry from Lloris, but France equalised again before time was out as Mbappe completed his hat trick with another penalty following a Gonzalo Montiel handball, sending the game to a shootout.
                        
                        The goal -- Mbappe's eighth in Qatar -- meant he became just the second man ever to score a hat trick in a World Cup final and helped him beat Messi to the tournament's Golden Boot award.
                        
                        Mbappe and Messi converted the two opening penalties, but Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez saved the next two France efforts from Kingsley Coman and Aurelien Tchouameni before Montiel stepped up and converted to help Argentina to a 4-2 win on penalties.</p>
